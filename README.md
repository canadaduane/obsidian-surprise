# Surprise Obsidian Plugin

This plugin enhances opening random notes, and is based on [smart-random-note](https://github.com/erichalldev/obsidian-smart-random-note).

Three commands are available:

-   Open Random Note from Search: opens a random note from the list of search results.
-   Insert Link at Cursor to Random Note from Search: inserts a link where the cursor is positioned to a raondom note from the list of search results.
-   Open Tagged Random Note: opens a random note that has a selected tag.
-   Open Random Note: behaves similarly to the core random note plugin.
