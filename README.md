# Smart Random Note Obsidian Plugin
This plugin enhances opening random notes.

Two commands are available:
- Open Random Note: behaves similarly to the core random note plugin.
- Open Tagged Random Note: opens a random note that has a selected tag.

## Future Plans
- Open a random note given a search string
- Save search strings
- Remember which notes have been seen for a given search string. 
  - Don't show the same note again until all have been seen or a certain amount of time has elapsed.
